Proect rules:
- Always use ShadCNUI components where possible. If not installed, install them using the 'shadcn@latest' package (Not 'shadcn-ui@latest' package)
- Do not use Typescript.
- Important: try to fix things at the cause, not the symptom.
- Favor clean and easily understandable code with minimal dependencies.
- Project uses NextJS 15
- Zod for form validations
- Always use apiClient for making API requests (in lib/api/client.js)
- Always group api endpoints into organised files, in the same format that 'lib/api/auth.js' does
- Always use kebab-case syntax for file names and imports of components in this project (eg. AuthLayout - 'auth-layout.js')
- Do not update the fonts used in any way.
- Always use TailwindCSS version 4 (v4)
