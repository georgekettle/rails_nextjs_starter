# Ruby & Rails 8 API Only Standards

This project adheres to strict Ruby and Rails versioning and is configured as an API-only application.

## Ruby Version

* **Only use Ruby 3.4.1.** Ensure all generated code and environment configurations reflect this.

## Rails Version & Application Type

* **Only use Rails 8.**
* This is an **API-only application**. This means:
    * No views (`app/views`).
    * No asset pipeline related code (e.g., `sprockets`, `webpacker`, `esbuild` configurations for frontend assets).
    * Focus on JSON responses only.
    * Route definitions should reflect API endpoints (e.g., `namespace :api do; namespace :v1 do; ... end; end`).
    * Avoid generating or requiring any frontend-specific boilerplate.

## General Coding Practices

* Follow standard Ruby and Rails community best practices for code style, naming conventions, and file structure.
* Prioritize clear, readable, and maintainable code.
* Write unit and integration tests for all new features and bug fixes.
